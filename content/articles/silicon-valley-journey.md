Four years ago, I was sitting in a CENG lab at 2 AM, debugging a data structures assignment and wondering if I'd ever be good enough to work at a top tech company. Today, I'm writing this from Google's Mountain View campus. Here's how I made it happen—and how you can too.

## The Dream Begins

Like many CENG students, I dreamed of working in Silicon Valley from my sophomore year. The combination of cutting-edge technology, incredible compensation, and the chance to impact billions of users was irresistible. But it felt impossibly far away.

**Reality check**: It's not impossible, but it requires strategic planning and relentless execution.

## Building the Foundation (Years 1-2)

### Academic Excellence
While grades aren't everything, they matter for international opportunities:
- **GPA**: I maintained a 3.7/4.0 throughout university
- **Core courses**: Excelled in algorithms, data structures, and systems programming
- **Mathematics**: Strong foundation in discrete math and statistics

### Programming Skills
I went beyond the curriculum:
- **Languages**: Mastered Java, Python, C++, and JavaScript
- **Daily practice**: Solved at least one algorithm problem every day
- **Personal projects**: Built 3-4 substantial projects showcasing different skills

### English Proficiency
This cannot be overstated for international careers:
- **TOEFL**: Scored 110/120 (aimed for 100+)
- **Technical communication**: Practiced explaining complex concepts in English
- **Consuming content**: Watched tech talks, read documentation, followed English-speaking developers

## The Strategic Phase (Years 3-4)

### Internship Strategy
I knew I needed international internship experience:

**Junior Year Summer**: Landed an internship at a Turkish tech company
- **Goal**: Build real-world experience and professional references
- **Outcome**: Strong performance review and return offer
- **Learning**: Enterprise software development practices

**Senior Year Summer**: Interned at a European startup (remote)
- **Goal**: International experience and exposure to different tech culture
- **Outcome**: Full-time offer and valuable network connections
- **Learning**: Startup agility and cross-cultural collaboration

### Skill Development
I focused on areas crucial for top tech companies:
- **System design**: Studied scalability, distributed systems, microservices
- **Algorithms**: Advanced beyond university curriculum
- **Open source**: Contributed to popular projects on GitHub
- **Leadership**: Led group projects and mentored junior students

### Networking
Building connections was crucial:
- **LinkedIn**: Connected with METU alumni in tech companies
- **Conferences**: Attended (virtually) major tech conferences
- **Online communities**: Active in relevant Discord servers and forums
- **Alumni network**: Reached out to METU graduates working abroad

## The Application Process

### Preparation (6 months before graduation)
- **Resume**: Crafted a US-style resume highlighting projects and impact
- **Portfolio**: Created a personal website showcasing my best work
- **LeetCode**: Solved 300+ problems, focusing on medium/hard difficulty
- **Mock interviews**: Practiced with friends and online platforms

### Target Companies
I applied strategically:
- **Tier 1**: Google, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple
- **Tier 2**: Uber, Airbnb, Netflix, Stripe
- **Tier 3**: Well-funded startups and scale-ups

### Application Timeline
- **September**: Started applications for new grad positions
- **October-November**: First round interviews
- **December-January**: On-site interviews
- **February**: Decision time

## The Interview Journey

### Phone Screens
Most companies start with 1-2 phone screens:
- **Technical**: Coding problems, usually 1-2 medium LeetCode-style questions
- **Behavioral**: Why this company, tell me about a challenging project
- **Preparation**: Practiced coding on a whiteboard and speaking out loud

### Technical Interviews
The most challenging part:
- **Coding**: 4-6 rounds of algorithm and data structure problems
- **System design**: Design a simplified version of a well-known system
- **Preparation**: Mock interviews with experienced engineers were invaluable

### Behavioral Interviews
Often underestimated but crucial:
- **STAR method**: Situation, Task, Action, Result
- **Leadership examples**: Times I led projects or resolved conflicts
- **Growth mindset**: How I learned from failures and adapted

## The Offers and Decision

### Results
Out of 15 applications:
- **8** reached phone screen stage
- **5** reached on-site interviews
- **3** received offers (Google, Amazon, and a startup)

### Negotiation
Having multiple offers gave me leverage:
- **Salary**: Negotiated base salary up by 15%
- **Signing bonus**: Secured additional signing bonus
- **Start date**: Negotiated a later start date for visa processing

### The Choice
I chose Google because:
- **Learning opportunities**: Exposure to massive scale systems
- **Team culture**: Emphasis on innovation and technical excellence
- **Career growth**: Clear paths for advancement
- **Impact**: Products used by billions of people

## Life in Silicon Valley

### The Transition
Moving to the US was challenging:
- **Visa process**: H-1B lottery (got lucky on first try)
- **Cultural adaptation**: Different work culture and social norms
- **Cost of living**: Much higher than Turkey, but salary compensates
- **Isolation**: Being far from family and old friends

### Work Experience
Working at Google has been incredible:
- **Technical growth**: Exposure to cutting-edge technology and practices
- **Mentorship**: Learning from some of the best engineers in the world
