    public StudentExample(String name, double gpa) {
        this.name = validateName(name);
        this.gpa = validateGPA(gpa);
    }
    
    private String validateName(String name) {
        if (name == null || name.trim().isEmpty()) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Name cannot be empty");
